# Sociables for NodeJS
### Please play responsibly!

## How to Play
Run `npm install` and then run `npm app` to start playing!

## Editing the Ruleset
Each rule is defined as an object with three properties: 

> `name`: the title of the card

> `description`: a plaintext description of the action taken when the given card is drawn

> `frequency`: how often the card appears in the deck, this can be a positive integer, or zero if you wish to omit the given rule

## License
I am releasing this under the terms of the [Do What the Fuck You Want to Public License](http://www.wtfpl.net), although the rules of the game were mostly just straight-up jacked from [sociablesrules.com](http://sociablesrules.com/rules/), so if I'm infringing on someone's copyright with this, submit and issue and I will come up with my own rules...
